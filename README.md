# Inkscape Extension For Joining Paths<br>
This extension lets the user join SVG paths <br>

# Installation
Copy join_paths.py and join_paths.inx in the user extension folder. The extension folder can be found from Edit->Preference dialog in the System option. You will need to restart inkscape after the files are copied.

# Usage
The effect is under Extensions->Modify Path menu. Select the paths that are to be joined and invoke the 'Join Paths' menu option. If the ending nodes of the paths to be joined don't coincide, an extra segment is created.<br>
